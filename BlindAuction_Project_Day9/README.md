## What is blind auction?

A first-price sealed-bid auction (FPSBA) is a common type of auction. 
It is also known as blind auction. 
In this type of auction, all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids so 
that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. 
The highest bidder pays the price that was submitted.
